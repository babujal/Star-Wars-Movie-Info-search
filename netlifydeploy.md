#### Prompt
> Netlify is a free web hosting service that works well for getting front-end projects onto the web quickly. It's fairly limited in it's functionality for full-stack projects but it will work great for what you're building in Unit 1.

## Getting Started

1. Go to `https://www.netlify.com/` and click sign up.

1. Once you've registered for an account, log in.

1. Press `cmd + space` at the same time and then type in Finder to open your file navigator. Locate where you have your project saved. You'll need to have this open in a minute.


## The Step By Step Guide to Deploying on Netlify
- Once you're logged in, click on the tab at the top that says `Sites`
- Towards the bottom of the page in the middle you'll see an area that says `Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git`, this is where we will be dragging and dropping your project directory.
- Once you drop your project directory, Netlify will take a few minutes to deploy your site.
-  Once your site is deployed, you will see the link for the automatically assigned. Click it to make sure everything went smoothly!


#### That's it, you have now succesfully deployed your project!
