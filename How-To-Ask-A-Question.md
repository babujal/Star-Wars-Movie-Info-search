# HOW TO ASK A QUESTION

## YOU ARE GOING TO NEED HELP.

It's inevitable. You cannot go your whole career never needing to ask another engineer to teach you things.

Since we are training you to be a self-sufficient and resourceful software engineer, we have some expectations around how you go about asking for help. 

The guidelines below will be **required** in this course and the habits they build will serve you well in your future SWE roles.

## BEFORE REACHING OUT TO AN INSTRUCTOR:
1. Ask a friend
1. Ask the sos channel
1. Ask the TA/IA in Office Hours 
_If you're stuck on a problem for a several hours and there are no office hours available within 24 hours time, you may skip this last step._
1. **Only once the above steps have been taken, message an instructor in Slack in the format and with all of the requirements listed below**

_NOTE: PUSH OFTEN! Your code on GitHub should be up to date when you ask us your question. Asking us a question and linking us to old, out of date code is obviously going to hinder the process of us helping you._

## THE IMPORTANCE OF ASKING FOR HELP THE RIGHT WAY
Once you decide it's time to reach out to another developer (or while you're in this class, an instructor), it's important to make well-worded and thoroughly-documented requests for help. The senior engineers on your future team are usually going to be very busy. This means that, when you ask them to take time out to assist you, you want to make the process as straightforward and efficient as possible for them.

#### *Bottom Line: Nobody likes to have to go fishing for information to help somebody else help themselves.*


# ASKING A ROBUST QUESTION

The steps listed below are a guide on how to ensure you're asking a robust question and providing all of the relevant information in your request for help.

## 1. PROVIDE CONTEXT

#### WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE:

Write a detailed explanation of the feature or user story you're working on.

#### DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUG/ERROR:

- **Provide a detailed description of the problem, the bug, and/or the error.**
*This means: the full steps to reproduce, a link to the most current file on Github, and the line number of where the relevant code is.*

- **Provide the error(s) returned, copy and pasted/typed out exactly as they appear/screenshot, never paraphrased.**

- **If there is other code in a different file that is also essential to the functioning of the code that currently works point us to that and explain the relationship.**

## 2. DISCUSS WHAT YOU HAVE TRIED

- List everything you've done to solve the bug on your own in detail. 
- List all resources you've looked up and tried to implement and provide links. 
- Provide code snippets or screenshots with explanatory comments so we know what you think each part is doing.
- List who you reached out to before the instructor and what they suggested you try.


## 3. ASK A DIRECT AND WELL-DEFINED QUESTION

*What is your question specifically. You need to be more specific than just asking something like "How can I make this work?"*

# EXAMPLE OF A WELL-WORDED & ROBUST REQUEST
![good example](https://i.imgur.com/sxosray.png)
- Notice there is an explanation of what the code should do, what the error is, where it can be found, links to the code on Github, screenshots of the relevant code, an explanation of what's been tried and a direct question/request for help. 
**Bottom Line: The person being asked for help has immediate access to everything they need to bug hunt the issue in this one message.**

# EXAMPLE OF AN POORLY-FORMULATED REQUEST
![poor example](https://i.imgur.com/CQ6gIai.png)
- Notice there is some information about what the student is trying to do but they aren't using well worded terminology to explain what their data looks like or what they're trying to do to it. 
- They included a screenshot but it's insufficient and does not show every potentially relevant line of code. 
- They did not include what steps they had taken to resolve the issue either. 
**Bottom Line: This is not going to help the person they're asking for help from to figure out what's going on.**

## CONCLUSION

Eventually the guidelines above will be second nature but for now, bookmark this page so you can refer to it whenever you need to request assistance in the course. Help others help you by asking for help in a way that gives them the information and the resources they need to provide what you're looking for.
